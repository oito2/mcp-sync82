// Package server builds the MCP server and wires each registered
// tools.Tool into it: New's AddTool call supplies the SDK with the tool's
// name, description, and input schema — which the SDK uses on its own to
// answer ListTools — plus a CallTool handler built by adapt. adapt runs
// the tool's Validate/Execute contract, recovers from panics so one
// tool's bug can't take down the connection, and sanitizes execution
// errors (via handleError) before they reach the client.
